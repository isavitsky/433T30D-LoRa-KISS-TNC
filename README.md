# 433T30D-LoRa-KISS-TNC

This project aims to make a better firmware for E32-DTU 433L30 LoRa data transceiver devices that can be actually used by radio amateurs as a cheap replacement for traditional 1200 baud AFSK TNCs.

LoRa employs a chirp modulation which delivers a better path power budget.

To install new firmware you will need to have an ST-LINK flasher and make some hardware changes to E32-DTU device that will void your warranty.

More details are on Wiki.

All hardware manipulations are on your own risk!
